<p>X-Yachts A/S was founded back in 1979, and the first yacht to
roll out of the doors of the factory in Haderslev, Denmark was
the 8 m One Design &quot;X-79&quot;. The brainchild of young
Danish designer, Niels Jeppesen, the X-79 was (and still is) a
fast, simple, non type formed yacht that met with instant
approval and strong fleets were quickly established in Denmark
Germany and Sweden. </p>

<p><img

align="left" hspace="0" width="273" height="217">By the mid
80&#146;s there was an increasing demand for a yacht with similar
qualities to the X-79, but of around 10 m. A One Design Class
yacht fast enough to beat existing yachts of similar size,
including ¾ ton racing yachts, yet comfortable enough to allow
for occasional or extended cruising. </p>

<p>The prototype of the X-99 was launched in 1985, and within one
week a staggering 100 boats were sold to clients who had paid a
small deposit based on a draft proposal test sailed hull #001 and
signed the actual order. No other boat, before or since has
enjoyed such a spectacular launch. Within the first 2 years the
X-99 had established fleets in Denmark Germany, Switzerland and
Holland. This list of accredited National fleets soon grew to
include the UK, Hong Kong, and most recently Sweden. </p>

align="right" hspace="0" width="133" height="129">Starting first
with National, then European, and finally World Championship
regattas the X-99 fleet has grown in both numbers and stature.
The 1989 World Cup was won by renowned American yachtsman Jim
Brady, and with Dutch, Hong Kong and Danish crews appearing on
the winner&#146;s rostrum over the years the fleet enjoys a truly
International flavour. Annual Championships attract participants
from up to 9 different countries, and up to 3 different
continents with fleet numbers constant at between 40 - 50 boats.
Since hull 001 took to the water in 1985 the X-99 has been
upgraded to include such standard X-Yachts features as a steel
bottom frame to replace the original glassed in wooden floors.
Other improvements include the upgrade of the Bukh engine to a
Volvo and aluminium window frames to replace the original
recessed Plexiglass panels. </p>

one name has stood out in the X-99 racing scene above all others,
and after winning his 3rd World Championship in a row we at
X-Yachts reluctantly decided that enough was enough, and offered
him a job. Dan Lindquist Pedersen is the name, and his principal
role in the company is to oversee &quot;end quality
control&quot;. Dan also brought with him his considerable talents
as a racing sailor which are put to good use in new product
development as well as allowing us to send a top class sailor to
test sail or race on X-Yachts around the World. </p>

<p align="left"><img
src="file:///C:/AAA/OVRIGT/BÅTEN/99'AN/Webb-sidan/99l.jpg"
align="right" hspace="0" width="222" height="167">It is the
success of Dan's X-99 &quot;<i>FAXE KONDI</i>&quot;, and his
ideas on setting up the X-99 for racing that has formed the basis
of the new deck layout and deck gear that is central to the
development of the X-99 Mk 2, so late 1996, ten years after the
first launch of the X-99, hull No 500 was delivered to our Dutch
importer. She was the first of this new Mk 2 version and can be
seen in the brochure. The deck layout plan in this brochure
reveals the principal changes on the X-99 Mk 2 all of which are
geared towards making the boat even more crew friendly and
efficient to sail and 100% &quot;race ready&quot; out of the box.
</p>

<p>To bring the X-99 more &quot;up to date&quot; the styling of
the waterlines has been changed, and the cabin windows have been
upgraded to a more &quot;classic&quot; look with two windows on
each side which, on request, can be made to be opening for better
ventilation in hot climates. </p>

<p><img

align="left" hspace="0" width="203" height="172">The interior of
the X-99 Mk 2 has also received an upgrade, with new materiel
being used for the freeboard linings, and distinctive new cushion
covers. </p>

<p>X-YACHTS has rejected the idea of replacing the X-99, or even
of producing a boat designed to compete in the same market, but
instead to develop the X-99 Mk 2: - </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>1. FACT</b></font>: Even in today's market,
the X-99 is still a very fast 33 footer, and up to now, no other
designer or producer has been able to build a boat that matches
the X-99 in its broad market appeal. &nbsp;Many of the &quot;One
Design Classes&quot; being introduced today are pure sports
boats, and in our judgment are aimed at such a narrow market that
they will never be able to sell in sufficient numbers to allow
true International Class racing. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b><img
src="file:///C:/AAA/OVRIGT/BÅTEN/99'AN/Webb-sidan/99j.jpg"
align="right" hspace="0" width="203" height="172"></b></font><font
size="4"><b>2. FACT</b></font>: More than 500 X-99's have been
built to date. Hence the tooling and development costs for this
boat have been paid off a long time ago. On price alone, the X-99
Mk 2 will out perform any other 10 m cruiser/racer. We invite you
to make your own comparison. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>3. FACT</b></font>: The X-99 is firmly
established as a Class, and it is highly improbable that any new
yacht, aiming for the same market can ever get close to the X-99.
&nbsp;National and International events organized by X-99
associations around the World afford the X-99 owner a well
structured, competitive racing forum that is hard (if not
impossible) to beat. </p>

<p><img
src="file:///C:/AAA/OVRIGT/BÅTEN/99'AN/Webb-sidan/99b.jpg"
align="left" hspace="0" width="186" height="151"> <font size="4"><b>4.
FACT</b></font>: Since 1989, the true One Design status of the
X-99 has been assured by the formation of the International X-99
Class Association. Together with X-YACHTS (one vote) each country
with a Nationally recognized fleet has one vote. The board of the
International X-99 Class Association has sufficient power to
protect the X-99 owner from unnecessary costs brought about by
inappropriate &quot;developments&quot; from within the class.
&nbsp;If you are serious about class racing but also want a boat
that you can cruise with family andfriends the X-99 is still the
Class to join. </p>

<p>Despite its recent appearance in many custom built IMS racing
yachts and &quot;look alike&quot; One Design yachts I do not feel
that the plumb bow is appropriate for a cruiser/racer as it makes
upwind sailing in choppy water a very wet experience. &nbsp;The
principal advantage of the low CG bulb keel is seen in cruising
yachts that are unlikely to have crew hiking on the rail.
&nbsp;We use this style of keel on the newer X-Yachts models for
that reason. &nbsp;The X-99 keel is of very low CG, being of
composite construction with a lead shoe bolted underneath the
cast iron keel </p>

<p>Fractional rigs supported by aft swept spreaders are currently
in vogue amongst modern sports boats, but have their roots in the
cruising scene. The principal benefit of such a rig is its
simplicity, not its performance. The X-99's spreaders are raked
aft 5<font size="2"><sup>o</sup></font> . &nbsp;This allows
sufficient safety margin to tack or gybe the boat without the
runners on, but the performance gain from having adjustable
runners is still inherent in the rig. A perfectly trimmed
fractional rig will always depend on having runners and
checkstays - the X-99 is &quot;born&quot; with these. </p>
